abstract = {In two landmark articles, Hanahan and Weinberg synthesized into one conceptual framework ‘the hallmarks of cancer’, a massive amount of information describing the characteristics of a cancer cell. Although this is neither the intention nor the belief of the authors, hallmarks are often interpreted as applying to a canonic cancer cell, or equally to all cells within a cancer. In this article, we clarify the separate concepts of causes, oncogenic events, signal transduction programs, and hallmarks to show that there is no unimodal relation between these concepts but a complex network of interrelations that vary in different cells, between cells, and at different times in any given cell. We consider cancer as an evolving, dynamic, and heterogeneous system, explaining, at least in part, the difficulty of treating cancer and supporting the use of simultaneous, multitarget therapies.}

abstract = {The design of an efficient computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) system for psoriasis severity assessment demands both accurate segmentation and classification of psoriasis lesions. Recently, few studies have been conducted to design automatic CADx systems for psoriasis severity assessment using traditional machine learning approaches. However, these approaches are highly featured dependent and require extensive and careful feature extraction. Among a large number of features extracted, assessing the features which contribute significantly to the classifier performing is a difficult and time-consuming task. Large features lead to poor generalization, due to high inter and intra-class variation of psoriasis skin lesions. This makes the task of implementing a reliable CADx system challenging. In such similar cases, Deep learning-based approaches have been proven better because of their ability to learn and make intelligent decisions automatically. In this study, a fully automated deep learning-based CADx system for psoriasis has been proposed. The system combines three modules in a single framework for achieving different objectives namely; recognition of psoriasis and non-psoriasis disease, automatic segmentation of psoriatic lesion, and its severity assessment. The modified U-Net and modified VGG-16 model have been implemented and trained for the segmentation and classification task respectively. The severity assessment module is capable of extracting discriminative features specifically related to the psoriatic lesion, which is automatically segmented by the segmentation module. The performance of the proposed CADx framework has been extensively evaluated on an extensive psoriasis dataset using k-fold cross-validation procedure. The appropriateness of the proposed system has been justified in terms of its performance at each of the three stages along with benchmarking against previously reported systems. Further, the system accuracy and reliability index has been evaluated for a dataset of varying size to validate the consistency of the proposed system.}

abstract = {Background
Melanoma is the most dangerous type of skin cancer but is curable if detected early. Recent publications demonstrated that artificial intelligence is capable in classifying images of benign nevi and melanoma with dermatologist-level precision. However, a statistically significant improvement compared with dermatologist classification has not been reported to date.
Methods
For this comparative study, 4204 biopsy-proven images of melanoma and nevi (1:1) were used for the training of a convolutional neural network (CNN). New techniques of deep learning were integrated. For the experiment, an additional 804 biopsy-proven dermoscopic images of melanoma and nevi (1:1) were randomly presented to dermatologists of nine German university hospitals, who evaluated the quality of each image and stated their recommended treatment (19,296 recommendations in total). Three McNemar's tests comparing the results of the CNN's test runs in terms of sensitivity, specificity and overall correctness were predefined as the main outcomes.
Findings
The respective sensitivity and specificity of lesion classification by the dermatologists were 67.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 62.6%–71.7%) and 62.2% (95% CI: 57.6%–66.9%). In comparison, the trained CNN achieved a higher sensitivity of 82.3% (95% CI: 78.3%–85.7%) and a higher specificity of 77.9% (95% CI: 73.8%–81.8%). The three McNemar's tests in 2 × 2 tables all reached a significance level of p < 0.001. This significance level was sustained for both subgroups.
Interpretation
For the first time, automated dermoscopic melanoma image classification was shown to be significantly superior to both junior and board-certified dermatologists (p < 0.001).}

The conventional treatment approaches for metastasis therapy have reported with immense adverse effects because they exhibited maximum probability of killing the carcinogenic cells along with healthy cells. The tumor vasculature, comprising of vasculogenic impressions and angiogenesis, greatly depends upon the growth and metastasis in the tumors. Therefore, various nanocarriers-based delivery approaches for targeting to tumor vasculature have been attempted as efficient and potential approaches for the treatment of tumor metastasis and the associated lesions. Furthermore, the targeted drug delivery approaches have found to be most apt way to overcome from all the limitations and adverse effects associated with the conventional therapies. In this review, various approaches for efficient targeting of pharmacologically active chemotherapeutics against tumor metastasis with the cohesive objectives of prognosis, tracking and therapy are summarized.}

              measure of the difference between the actual output vector of the

              adjustments, internal `hidden' units which are not part of the
              input or output come to represent important features of the task
              domain, and the regularities in the task are captured by the
              interactions of these units. The ability to create useful new

abstract = {Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) has become one of the major research subjects in medical imaging and diagnostic radiology. In this article, the motivation and philosophy for early development of CAD schemes are presented together with the current status and future potential of CAD in a PACS environment. With CAD, radiologists use the computer output as a “second opinion” and make the final decisions. CAD is a concept established by taking into account equally the roles of physicians and computers, whereas automated computer diagnosis is a concept based on computer algorithms only. With CAD, the performance by computers does not have to be comparable to or better than that by physicians, but needs to be complementary to that by physicians. In fact, a large number of CAD systems have been employed for assisting physicians in the early detection of breast cancers on mammograms. A CAD scheme that makes use of lateral chest images has the potential to improve the overall performance in the detection of lung nodules when combined with another CAD scheme for PA chest images. Because vertebral fractures can be detected reliably by computer on lateral chest radiographs, radiologists’ accuracy in the detection of vertebral fractures would be improved by the use of CAD, and thus early diagnosis of osteoporosis would become possible. In MRA, a CAD system has been developed for assisting radiologists in the detection of intracranial aneurysms. On successive bone scan images, a CAD scheme for detection of interval changes has been developed by use of temporal subtraction images. In the future, many CAD schemes could be assembled as packages and implemented as a part of PACS. For example, the package for chest CAD may include the computerized detection of lung nodules, interstitial opacities, cardiomegaly, vertebral fractures, and interval changes in chest radiographs as well as the computerized classification of benign and malignant nodules and the differential diagnosis of interstitial lung diseases. In order to assist in the differential diagnosis, it would be possible to search for and retrieve images (or lesions) with known pathology, which would be very similar to a new unknown case, from PACS when a reliable and useful method has been developed for quantifying the similarity of a pair of images for visual comparison by radiologists.}
